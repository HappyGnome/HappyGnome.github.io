The player whose allocated day preceded the current day is to be the Judge and decide\nthe question. After considering the statement, they pronounce their verdict by typing \u201cJudgement:\u201d\nfollowed by their decision into the Telegram voting chat. This must reference the original Point of\nOrder.\n", "Following the pronouncement, there is a one hour period in which any of the other players may\ndispute the decision. They do this by typing \u201cDispute:\u201d followed by a reference to the Judgement\ninto the voting thread. Players other than the Judge then have one hour to each type either \u201cI agree\nwith Judgement...\u201d or \u201cI disagree with Judgement...\u201d followed by a reference to the Judgement.\nIf no one disputes the decision within an hour or a single player other than the Judge agrees then\nthe decision comes into effect.

The same applies for the new Judge. Any proposed\nrule-change involved in a dispute is voted on in the usual fashion, but if approved whilst still\nawaiting Judgement, the rule is not taken into effect until all the related Judgements are invoked.\nThis has precedence over Rule 206.
