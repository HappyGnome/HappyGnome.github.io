At the specified end time, control shall return to the player as if they had typed \"Proxy revoked\" in the Telegram voting thread. If a date is specified without a time, the end date shall be construed as the end of the named day. If no end date is specified, the Proxy continues until further notice.\n</p><p>\n7.

Any messages in the Telegram voting thread sent by a player with an Active Proxy are considered void, except for any message of the form \"Proxy revoked\".\n</p><p>\n9.

If, at any time under Rule <a href=\"31\" class=\"a_rule\">214</a>, a player who has an Active Proxy is called to be Judge, then the Proxy shall become the Judge for that Point of Order, unless the Proxy is either the player who invoked the Point of Order, or the player whose allocated day it is under Rule <a href=\"18\" class=\"a_rule\">201</a>, in which case the player next in the List of Judges for that Point of Order shall become the Judge for that Point of Order.\"\n</p>", "label": "318", "linksto": {"days": ["21"], "props": [], "rules": ["31", "34"]}, "ineffect": "1", "date": "2019-03-12"}, "4": {"author": "Initial", "notes": [], "text": "<p>\nEvery player is an eligible voter.\n</p>", "label": "105", "linksto": {"days": [], "props": [], "rules": ["4"]}, "ineffect": "1", "date": "2019-02-11"}, "31": {"author": "Initial", "notes": [], "text": "<p>\nIf players disagree about the legality of a move or the interpretation or application of a rule, then\nany player may call for a Judgement on the decision.
